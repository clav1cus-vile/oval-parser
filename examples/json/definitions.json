To efficiently process SACK blocks, the Linux kernel merges multiple fragmented SKBs into one, potentially overflowing the variable holding the number of segments. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the Linux kernel by sending a crafted sequence of SACK segments on a TCP connection with small value of TCP MSS, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). (CVE-2019-11477)\n\n* kernel: lack of check for mmap minimum address in expand_downwards in mm/mmap.c leads to NULL pointer dereferences exploit on non-SMAP platforms (CVE-2019-9213)\n\n* Kernel: tcp: excessive resource consumption while processing SACK blocks allows remote denial of service (CVE-2019-11478)\n\n* Kernel: tcp: excessive resource consumption for TCP connections with low MSS allows remote denial of service (CVE-2019-11479)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* kernel-rt: update to the RHEL8.0.z batch#1 source tree (BZ#1704955)",

This meant that containers running on a FIPS mode kernel would not enable FIPS mode without the crypto policy being changed. With this update, OpenJDK queries the NSS library as to whether FIPS mode is active or not. (RHBZ#2014201)\n\n* The use of the NSS FIPS mode by OpenJDK requires the JDK to login to the NSS software token. Previously, this happened indirectly as part of some crypto operations, but not others. With this update, the JDK logs in to the token on initialisation. (RHBZ#2014204)\n\n* While in FIPS mode, the NSS Software Token does not allow the import of private or secret plain keys. This caused the OpenJDK keytool application to fail when used with OpenJDK in FIPS mode. With this update, OpenJDK will now import such keys into the NSS database. This behaviour may be disabled using -Dcom.redhat.fips.plainKeySupport=false. (RHBZ#2014193)",

These new deny-by-default lints detect affected codepoints in string literals and comments. The lints will prevent source code file containing these codepoints from being compiled.

(BZ#2084650)\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* OpenJDK: integer truncation issue in Xalan-J (JAXP, 8285407) (CVE-2022-34169)\n\n* OpenJDK: class compilation issue (Hotspot, 8281859) (CVE-2022-21540)\n\n* OpenJDK: improper restriction of MethodHandle.invokeBasic() (Hotspot, 8281866) (CVE-2022-21541)\n\n* OpenJDK: random exponentials issue (Libraries, 8283875) (CVE-2022-21549)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* Previous Red Hat builds of OpenJDK 17 altered the arguments passed to sun.security.pkcs11.wrapper.PKCS11.getInstance() in order to facilitate FIPS support. This build adds an additional form of the method, retaining the original arguments, so that applications which depend on this internal method continue to function with Red Hat builds of OpenJDK. (BZ#2099913)\n\n* With previous Red Hat builds of OpenJDK 17, Mac key generation and import would fail due to the lack of the CKA_SIGN attribute on the key. This attribute is now added as part of the NSS FIPS configuration. (BZ#2108190)\n\n* With the release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6, a change was made so that disabling OpenJDK FIPS mode required the use of both the -Djava.security.disableSystemPropertiesFile=true and -Dcom.redhat.fips=false options, with the intention that FIPS mode could be controlled independently of system security properties. This change has now been reverted and only -Djava.security.disableSystemPropertiesFile=true is required to disable FIPS mode, as in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4. (BZ#2108206)\n\n* Previous Red Hat builds of OpenJDK 17 running in FIPS mode with a SecurityManager would fail due to a lack of module access permissions. This has now been corrected. (BZ#2108209)",

It provides aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* systemd: local information leak due to systemd-coredump not respecting fs.suid_dumpable kernel setting (CVE-2022-4415)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* systemd doesn't record messages to the journal during boot (BZ#2164049)",

It is now enabled in FIPS mode. (RHBZ#2186827)\n\n* The PKCS#11 provider used by FIPS mode can be supported by different PKCS#11 tokens. It was found that some PKCS#11 tokens may not be initialised fully before use, leading to an exception being thrown by the provider. With this release, this exception is now expected and handled by the FIPS support code. (RHBZ#2186831)",

This release, 17.0.9, allows for zero-length headers and additional padding produced by some Zip64 creation tools.

      "description": "The java-21-openjdk packages provide the OpenJDK 21 Java Runtime Environment and the OpenJDK 21 Java Software Development Kit.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* OpenJDK: memory corruption issue on x86_64 with AVX-512 (8317121) (CVE-2023-22025)\n\n* OpenJDK: certificate path validation issue during client authentication (8309966) (CVE-2023-22081)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* Additional validity checks in the handling of Zip64 files, JDK-8302483, were introduced in the 21.0.0 release of OpenJDK, causing the use of some valid zip files to now fail with an error. This release, 21.0.1, allows for zero-length headers and additional padding produced by some Zip64 creation tools. With both releases, the checks can be disabled using -Djdk.util.zip.disableZip64ExtraFieldValidation=true.\n\n* A maximum signature file size property, jdk.jar.maxSignatureFileSize, was introduced in the 20.0.0 release of OpenJDK by JDK-8300596, with a default of 8 MB. This default proved to be too small for some JAR files. This release, 20.0.1, increases it to 16 MB. (RHEL-14952)\n\n* When Transparent Huge Pages (THP) are unconditionally enabled on a system, Java applications using many threads were found to have a large Resident Set Size (RSS). This was due to a race between the kernel transforming thread stack memory into huge pages and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) shattering these pages into smaller ones when adding a guard page. This release resolves this issue by getting glibc to insert a guard page and prevent the creation of huge pages. (RHEL-14961)\n\n* Installing the same java-21-openjdk-headless package on two different systems resulted in distinct classes.jsa files getting generated. This was because the CDS archive was being generated by a post script action of the java-21-openjdk-headless package. This prevented the use of the dynamic dump feature, because the checksum in the archive would be different on each system. This release resolves this issue by using the .jsa files generated during the initial build. (RHEL-14944)\n\n* The /usr/bin/jfr alternative is now owned by the java-21-openjdk package. (RHEL-14960)\n\n* The jcmd tool is now provided by the java-21-openjdk-headless package, rather than java-21-openjdk-devel, to make it more accessible. (RHEL-14950)",
